Description: The 'dtseries' package provides a collection of functions to extend 
             the capabilities of R's native 'ts' class, offering convenient tools for 
             manipulating, transforming, visualizing, and analyzing time series data. 
             It includes functions for merging, splitting, resizing, extending, 
             calculating time changes, generating seasonal dummies, detecting 
             breakpoints, and more.

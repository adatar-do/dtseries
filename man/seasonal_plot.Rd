\usage{
seasonal_plot(data, .seasons = NULL, .smooth = FALSE, .freq = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A time series object of class \code{ts} or a data frame with a "date" column and numeric columns
representing the time series.}

\item{.seasons}{An optional vector of seasons to include in the plot (e.g., 1:4 for quarters, 1:12
for months). If NULL (default), all seasons are included.}

\item{.smooth}{Logical. Should a smooth trend line be added to the plot? Default is FALSE.}

\item{.freq}{The frequency of the time series (e.g., 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly). If NULL (default),
the frequency is automatically estimated from the data.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{ggplot2::geom_smooth()}.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object displaying the seasonal plot.
}
\description{
This function generates a seasonal plot, visualizing time series data by year and season
(e.g., quarters or months).

\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Using a data frame
  data(economics, package = "ggplot2")
  seasonal_plot(economics, var_name = "unemploy", .freq = 12)

  # Using a time series object
  data(AirPassengers)
  seasonal_plot(AirPassengers)

  # Plot only specific quarters
  seasonal_plot(AirPassengers, .seasons = c(1, 4))
